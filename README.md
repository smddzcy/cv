A simple, modern CV / resume template. Click [here](https://smddzcy.com/cv/) to see an example.

## Creating Your CV

(You need `npm` in order to build the project. If it's not installed, install npm from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm))

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Fill in the `.json` files in `src/contents` with your information. [Click here to find out how to fill those files.](#filling-your-information)

3. Run `grunt build` and get your fresh CV in the HTML format from `dist/index.html`.

If you want it in the PDF format, you can print the page as a PDF from your browser, just like I do all the time.

**Note:** `src/contents/color_palette.json` contains the color settings of your CV. There is a fixed set of colors, and you can look at your options from that file (`colorOptions` field) or [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smddzcy/cv/master/src/img/color-palette.jpg) or `src/img/color-palette.jpg` file.
